# 8-Puzzle Solver

## Project Description
This Python project implements a solution to the 8-puzzle problem, a classic sliding puzzle that consists of a 3x3 grid with 8 numbered tiles and one empty space. The goal is to rearrange the tiles to achieve a specific goal state by sliding tiles into the empty space. This solver uses two heuristic functions to aid the search:
1. **Manhattan Distance**: The sum of the distances of each tile from its goal position.
2. **Misplaced Tiles**: The count of tiles that are not in their goal position.
